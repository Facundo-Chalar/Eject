Eject is a Java open-source frontend based on LiveStreamer.It lets you pop-out twitch.tv streams to VLC player in an easy way!
It works nice to bypass firewalls/parental controls twitch block.
Requirements:
-Java installed.
-VLC Player.
-LiveStreamer for the standalone version.
-Internet connection (to open streams).

FAQ:

Only works with twitch? Yes,because is a personal project to bypass a proxy,but u can add all the services supported by livestreamer
modifiyng just a line of code in the main form.I will do it in next versions.

It shows "Configuration file not found" error,or something like that,why?
It can happen the first time the app is executed,if the user choose the path to livestreamer executable file ("livestreamer.exe") this shouldn't happen anymore.

I just want a exe,i dont want to compile the code or use a jar!
I'll post the compiled version for windows here in some days.

It works on linux/unix based systems? 
Not this version,cause it has windows CMD commands to interact with livestreamer,i have another version that interacts with the livestreamer API,send me a PM for that!

How can i contact you?
